I could not find this plugin anywhere on the net anymore so I've brought it into github without changes. I haven't tested it thoroughly for Rails 2+, but it seems to work OK for me.

=  numberToWords - convert your integers and floats to english, japanese, or american currency (dollars)

- This plugin was created from a solution to the ruby quiz (english numbers) by Matthew D Moss.  I modified the code to work as a rails plugin and added the to_dollars method.
- the to_dollars method will work with integers and floats
- the to_english and to_japaneese methods will only work with integers.  If you have call these methods on a float, it will be converted to an integer before translating.

= Examples
 123.to_english == one hundred and twenty-three
 123.to_japaneese == hyaku niju san
 123.to_dollars == one hundred and twenty-three dollars
 money = 123.23
 money.to_dollars == one hundred and twenty-three dollars and twenty-three cents
 money = 1.01
 money.to_dollars == one dollar and one cent
